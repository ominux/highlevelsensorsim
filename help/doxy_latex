@section ccdphotosensor High-level photosensor mode 

Many noise sources contribute to the resulting noise image that is produced by
photosensors. Noise sources can be broadly classified as either
@b fixed-pattern (time-invariant) or @b temporal (time-variant)
noise. Fixed-pattern noise refers to any spatial pattern that does not change
significantly from frame to frame. Temporal noise, on the other hand, changes
from one frame to the next. These noise sources will be described in detail in
the following parts of the simulator.
