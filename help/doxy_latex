@subsection PRNUadd Photo response non-uniformity
The Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) is the spatial variation in pixel
output under uniform illumination mainly due to variations in the surface area
of the photodiodes. This occurs due to variations in substrate material during
the fabrication of the sensor. The PRNU is signal-dependent (proportional to the
input signal) and is fixed-pattern (time-invariant). The PRNU factor is
typically \f$0.01\dots 0.02\f$ for a given sensor, but varies from one sensor to
another. The simulation of the PRNU noise is described @ref prnusim "here".
