@section sourcefollowerdescr Source Follower
Conventional sensor use a floating-diffusion sense node followed by a
charge-to-voltage amplifier, such as a @b source @b follower.

Source follower is one of basic single-stage field effect transistor (FET)
amplifier topologies that is typically used as a voltage buffer. In such a
circuit, the gate terminal of the transistor serves as the input, the source is
the output, and the drain is common to both input and output. At low
frequencies, the source follower has voltage gain:

\f$    {A_{\text{v}}} = \frac{v_{\text{out}}}{v_{\text{in}}} = \frac{g_m R_{\text{S}}}{g_m R_{\text{S}} + 1} \approx 1 \qquad (g_m R_{\text{S}} \gg 1) \f$

Source follower is a voltage follower, its gain is less than 1. Source followers
are used to preserve the linear relationship between incident light, generated
photoelectrons and the output voltage.


@subsection sourcefollowernonlin V/V gain source follower non-linearity
The V/V non-linearity affect shot noise (but does not affect FPN curve) and can
cause some shot-noise probability density compression. The V/V
non-linearity non-linearity is caused by non-linear response in ADC or source
follower. 

The V/V non-linearity can be simulated as a change in source follower gain
\f$A_{SF}\f$ as 
a linear function of signal:

 \f$A_{SF_{new}} = \alpha \cdot \frac{V_{REF} - S(V_{SF}) }{V_{REF} } +
A_{SF},\f$ @n

where \f$\alpha = A_{SF}\cdot\frac{\gamma_{nlr} -1}{ V_{FW} }\f$ and
\f$\gamma_{nlr}\f$ is a non-linearity ratio of \f$A_{SF}\f$. In the simulation
we assume \f$A_{SF} = 1\f$ and \f$\gamma_{nlr} = 1.05\f$ i.e. 5\% of
non-linearity of \f$A_{SF}\f$. Then the voltage is multiplied on the new sense
node gain \f$A_{SF_{new}}\f$:

  \f$I_{V} = I_{V}\cdot A_{SF_{new}}\f$ @n

 After that, the voltage goes to ADC for quantisation to digital numbers.
