@section fresnel_propIR One-step Fresnel Impulse Response (propIR) propagator
Another propagation approach~\cite{voelz2011computational} can be devised based on the impulse response:

\f$ U_2(x,y) = \mathcal{F}^{-1} \{ \mathcal{F}(U_1(x,y) ) \mathcal{F}(h(x,y)  \}, \mbox{ where } h(x,y) =  \frac{  \exp[ikz]  }{i \lambda z }  \exp\left[   \frac{e^{ik} }{2z} (x^2 +y^2) \right] \f$

Here in \f$\exp\left[   \frac{e^{ik} }{2z} (x^2 +y^2) \right]\f$ we apparently use the Fresnel approximation.

The propIR code is similar to the propTF function, where the source and observation planes assumed to have the same side length. 

Due to numerical artifacts, the IR approach turns out to be more limited in terms of the situations where it should be used than the TF approach, however, it provides a way to simulate propagation over longer distances and is useful for the discussion of simulation limitations and artifacts.
